## What I Bring
Proven ability to wear multiple hats while delivering consistent results.  
From VPC design and automation to Kubernetes-ready pipelines, I help teams ship faster without sacrificing reliability.

## Core Expertise
- **Cloud architecture:** AWS VPC, subnets, routing, IAM, HA/DR patterns
  
- **Infrastructure as Code:** Terraform/CloudFormation modules for repeatable environments
- **CI/CD:** GitHub Actions/Jenkins—build/test/deploy, blue-green & canary releases, automated rollbacks
- **Containers:** Docker; ECS Fargate; EKS (foundations); image versioning and releases
- **Observability & Ops:** CloudWatch logs/metrics/alarms, runbooks, incident response basics
- **Cost & performance:** rightsizing, autoscaling, caching, budgets & alerts
- **Collaboration:** clear diagrams, READMEs, and PR reviews that keep everyone aligned
  
AWS, VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, IAM, Route 53, EC2, S3, RDS, Lambda, CloudFront, CloudWatch, Terraform, CloudFormation, GitHub Actions, Jenkins, Docker, ECS, EKS, Git, GitOps, Blue-Green, Canary, Autoscaling, High Availability, Disaster Recovery, Monitoring, Alerting, Cost Optimization, Linux, Bash

## What Excites Me
Working with teams that value both technical excellence and clear communication.
I thrive in environments where I can architect solutions, implement best practices,
and help others understand the "why" behind infrastructure decisions.
